    <!-- How it Works -->
    <div>

      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>
        We want to provide a non-intrusive resource that people who feel
        isolated will want to use. Designed to be a safe, secure place to
        express yourself, the Glass Bottle allows users to write about
        their feelings anonymously and then automatically deletes any text
        typed into its field. This is perfect for those struggling with
        depression who may not feel confident enough to confide in a real
        person. Our website then helps these individuals to gain confidence
        and recuperate by offering increasing levels of sharing: users can
        first vent without saving, then they can post anonymously to support
        others in their positions, and lastly, can join anonymous chats
        where they discuss their issues with real people who have struggled
        with the same issues.
      </p>

      <h1>How it Works</h1>
      <p>
        How does the Glass Bottle work? The text you type isn’t even sent
        to our page. It exists on the surface of your computer and
        disappears as soon as you press “send”. Doesn’t even cross the
        internet or leave your home, unless you choose so: if you do feel
        like sharing your writing with people in similar situations, you can
        log in and press “post” to share your anonymous thoughts to positively
        impact others.
      </p>
